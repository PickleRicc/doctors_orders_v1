# ‚úÖ Export/Display Fixes - COMPLETE

## üêõ Issue Found:
The PDF and Copy exports were not displaying objective test results properly because the export functions were still using the old flat `rows` structure instead of the new categorized structure.

## üîß Fixes Applied:

### 1. **SOAPEditor.jsx - Export Functions Updated**

#### formatObjectiveForText() - Fixed ‚úÖ
- Now handles **categorized structure** with `categories` array
- Properly displays: `Test: Result - Notes`
- Falls back to old `rows` structure for backward compatibility
- Shows category headers (Observation, Palpation, etc.)

**Output format:**
```
Observation:
  Knee Effusion/Swelling: Moderate - Joint line swelling present
  Gait Pattern: Antalgic - Decreased stance time

Palpation:
  Joint Line Tenderness: Positive - Medial joint line tender
```

#### formatObjectiveForPDF() - Fixed ‚úÖ
- Same logic as text export
- Handles categories and displays all fields properly

#### formatAssessmentForText() - NEW ‚úÖ
- Handles composite structure with:
  - Clinical Impression (WYSIWYG content)
  - Short-term Goals (bullet list)
  - Long-term Goals (bullet list)

**Output format:**
```
ASSESSMENT:
Patient presents with likely meniscus tear...

Short-term Goals (2-4 weeks):
  ‚Ä¢ Reduce pain from 6/10 to 3/10
  ‚Ä¢ Increase knee flexion to 120¬∞

Long-term Goals (6-12 weeks):
  ‚Ä¢ Return to recreational sports
  ‚Ä¢ Independent with HEP
```

#### formatPlanForText() - NEW ‚úÖ
- Handles composite structure with:
  - Interventions (bullet list)
  - Progressions (bullet list)
  - Regressions (bullet list)
  - Frequency/Duration (text)
  - Patient Education (text)

**Output format:**
```
PLAN:
Interventions:
  ‚Ä¢ Knee mobilizations
  ‚Ä¢ Quad strengthening
  ‚Ä¢ Hamstring stretching

Progressions:
  ‚Ä¢ Increase resistance gradually
  ‚Ä¢ Add balance exercises

Regressions:
  ‚Ä¢ Reduce ROM if pain increases
  ‚Ä¢ Return to isometrics

Frequency/Duration:
2x/week for 4 weeks, expected timeline for reassessment

Patient Education:
Home exercise program, activity modifications, precautions
```
