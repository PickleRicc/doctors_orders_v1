## 🎯 What Works Now

### User Flow
1. ✅ User sees blob placeholder + template selector
2. ✅ Click template → blob changes color, "Start Recording" appears
3. ✅ Click record → timer starts, waveform animates
4. ✅ Click stop → session name input appears
5. ✅ Enter name → processing state → SOAP editor appears
6. ✅ Click "New Note" → returns to idle state

### Sidebar
- ✅ Fetches notes from API
- ✅ Displays note list with template icons
- ✅ Click note → loads in SOAP editor
- ✅ Collapsible on mobile
- ✅ Search functionality

### State Transitions
- ✅ idle → templateSelected (pick template)
- ✅ templateSelected → recording (start recording)
- ✅ recording → processing (stop recording)
- ✅ processing → editing (AI complete)
- ✅ viewing → idle (new note button)
- ✅ sidebar click → viewing (load old note)

### Desktop
- [ ] Navigate to `/index-new` (or rename to `/`)
- [ ] Sidebar visible on left
- [ ] Blob placeholder animates
- [ ] Template selector shows 6 buttons
- [ ] Click template → blob changes color
- [ ] Click record → recording interface appears
- [ ] Timer counts up
- [ ] Click stop → name input appears
- [ ] Enter name → processing state
- [ ] SOAP editor appears (reuses existing component)
- [ ] Click "New Note" → returns to blob
- [ ] Click note in sidebar → loads note

### Mobile

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Existing Components (Reused)
- ✅ `SOAPEditor.jsx` - Used for editing/viewing notes
- ✅ `ObjectiveTable.jsx` - Part of SOAP editor
- ✅ `WYSIWYGEditor.jsx` - Part of SOAP editor
- ✅ `GoalsList.jsx` - Part of SOAP editor
- ✅ `InterventionsList.jsx` - Part of SOAP editor

### API Endpoints (Need to work)
- ✅ `GET /api/phi/encounters` - Fetch note list (sidebar)
- ⚠️ `POST /api/phi/encounters` - Create new encounter (recording)
- ⚠️ `PUT /api/phi/encounters/:id` - Update encounter (auto-save)
- ⚠️ `POST /api/phi/transcribe` - Transcribe audio (after recording)
- ⚠️ `POST /api/phi/generate` - Generate SOAP (AI processing)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Phase 1)

### Placeholder Features
- 🔲 3D blob is CSS placeholder (Phase 2 will add real 3D)
- 🔲 Waveform is animated divs (Phase 2 will add real audio viz)
- 🔲 Recording doesn't upload to Azure Blob yet
- 🔲 AI generation is simulated (2s timeout)
- 🔲 No actual audio transcription yet

### Missing Integrations
- 🔲 Template hooks not integrated (need to wire up)
- 🔲 Azure Blob SAS upload not implemented
- 🔲 Real AI service calls not connected
- 🔲 Auto-save not implemented in new flow

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Complete Phase 1
1. **Test the flow** - Navigate to `/index-new` and test all states
2. **Wire up APIs** - Connect RecordingInterface to real endpoints
3. **Integrate templates** - Use template hooks for AI generation
4. **Fix any bugs** - Ensure smooth transitions

### Before Moving to Phase 2
- [ ] All state transitions work smoothly
- [ ] Sidebar loads and displays notes correctly
- [ ] Recording saves to Azure DB
- [ ] AI generation creates SOAP notes
- [ ] SOAP editor loads and saves properly
- [ ] Mobile responsive works

### Ready for Phase 2 When:
- ✅ Structure is solid
- ✅ Flow is tested
- ✅ No major bugs
- ✅ APIs are connected
- 🎨 Ready to add 3D magic!

## 📝 Notes

### File Naming
- Created `index-new.jsx` to avoid breaking current app
- Once tested, can rename to `index.jsx` and deprecate old pages

### Backward Compatibility
- Old `/soap/new` and `/soap/generate` routes still work
- Can run both versions side-by-side during testing
- Gradual migration possible

### Performance
- Lazy load SOAP editor (only when needed)
- Sidebar virtualizes long note lists
- Optimistic updates for better UX
