    title: "Knee Evaluation - Post ACL Surgery",
    transcript: `
      Patient is a 28-year-old female, 6 weeks post ACL reconstruction surgery on the right knee.
      She reports pain level is currently 4 out of 10 with activity, 2 out of 10 at rest.
      Main complaint is stiffness in the morning and difficulty with stairs.
      She's been doing her home exercises regularly but feels like she's plateauing.
      
      On examination, I observed mild swelling around the knee joint, particularly on the medial side.
      Range of motion testing shows flexion to 95 degrees, which is limited, normal should be around 135.
      Extension is lacking about 5 degrees from full extension.
      
      Strength testing reveals quadriceps strength is 3+ out of 5, significant weakness noted.
      Hamstring strength is 4 out of 5, better but still needs work.
      
      Special tests: Lachman test negative, which is good - graft is stable.
      McMurray test negative for meniscus issues.
      Anterior drawer test also negative.
      
      Gait analysis shows she's still favoring the right leg, slight Trendelenburg sign present.
      Balance testing on single leg stance: can hold for 15 seconds with eyes open, 5 seconds with eyes closed.
      
      Plan is to continue with therapeutic exercises, focusing on quadriceps strengthening.
      Will add more aggressive ROM exercises, particularly for flexion.
      Starting proprioception training and balance work.
      Recommend continuing 2 times per week for next 4 weeks.
      Home exercise program updated with new exercises.

      Left ankle dorsiflexion 4 out of 5.
      Deep tendon reflexes: patellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally.
      Achilles reflexes: right 2+, left diminished at 1+.
      
      Special tests: Straight leg raise positive on left at 30 degrees.
      Crossed straight leg raise also positive, indicating disc involvement.
      Slump test positive with reproduction of leg symptoms.
      
      Palpation reveals significant tenderness at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.
      Muscle spasm palpable in left quadratus lumborum and erector spinae.
      
      Assessment consistent with L5-S1 disc herniation with L5 nerve root involvement.
      Plan includes gentle McKenzie exercises, starting with prone lying progressing to extension.
      Neural mobilization techniques once acute phase subsides.
      Core stabilization exercises as tolerated.
      Education on proper body mechanics and posture.
      Recommend 3 times per week initially for 2 weeks, then reassess.
