  knee_evaluation: "This is a comprehensive evaluation for a 45-year-old male software engineer presenting with right knee pain. The patient reports that the pain began approximately 2 weeks ago after increasing his running mileage from 3 miles to 5 miles three times per week. He describes the pain as sharp and intermittent, located primarily on the medial aspect of the right knee, and rates it as a 6/10 during activity and 3/10 at rest. Pain is significantly worse when ascending and descending stairs and after sitting for prolonged periods. Patient also reports occasional clicking, popping sensations, and morning stiffness that lasts about 20-30 minutes after waking. The patient denies any specific injury event but mentions that he recently changed his running shoes. No previous injuries to this knee, though he did have a mild left ankle sprain about 2 years ago that resolved with PT. Patient is otherwise healthy, takes no medications regularly, and has been running consistently for fitness for the past 5 years. He reports his goals are to return to pain-free running and be able to participate in a 10K race scheduled in 3 months.\n\nUpon objective examination, the patient presents with an antalgic gait pattern, demonstrating decreased stance time on the right lower extremity and reduced knee flexion during swing phase. Observation reveals mild joint effusion of the right knee with no visible bruising or deformity. Active range of motion measurements show right knee flexion limited to 0-110 degrees with pain reported at end range, compared to 0-135 degrees on the left. Extension is full bilaterally. Passive ROM of the right knee produces pain at end-range flexion and reveals increased pain with medial joint line palpation. Strength testing demonstrates quadriceps weakness at 4-/5 on the right compared to 5/5 on the left, and hamstrings at 4/5 on the right compared to 5/5 on the left. Special tests are positive for McMurray's with pain and clicking on the medial side, negative Lachman's test, negative anterior and posterior drawer tests, and negative valgus and varus stress tests. Patellar tracking appears slightly lateral with a positive Clarke's test. Palpation reveals tenderness along the medial joint line and mild tenderness of the pes anserine bursa. No significant tenderness along the lateral joint line, patellar tendon, or IT band.\n\nAssessment: Patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with a medial meniscus irritation/tear and early patellofemoral pain syndrome. Contributing factors include possible training errors with sudden increase in running volume, potential biomechanical factors including mild pronation observed during stance phase, and quadriceps weakness. Functional limitations include inability to run, difficulty with stairs, and pain with prolonged sitting.\n\nFor our treatment plan, we will start with a focus on pain management using ice application 15-20 minutes 3x/day, gentle ROM exercises, and activity modification including temporary cessation of running with substitution of low-impact cardiovascular activities like swimming or cycling. I'm recommending PT 2 times per week for 4-6 weeks. Initial interventions will include gentle joint mobilizations, soft tissue mobilization to the medial structures of the knee, quadriceps and hamstring strengthening with emphasis on VMO activation, and progressive weight-bearing exercises as tolerated. The home exercise program will include quad sets, straight leg raises, heel slides, and hamstring stretches to be performed 2x/day. Short-term goals include reducing pain to 2/10 or less during daily activities within 2 weeks and increasing knee flexion to 125 degrees. Long-term goals include returning to a normal gait pattern within 3 weeks, achieving full, pain-free ROM within 4 weeks, 5/5 strength in all knee musculature within 6 weeks, and gradual return to running with a proper training progression plan starting at week 6-8 depending on progress.",
  
  shoulder_progress: "Today is our 5th session for right shoulder impingement. Patient reports pain has decreased from 7/10 to 4/10. Can now reach overhead without significant pain. AROM improved to 160 degrees flexion, 150 degrees abduction. External rotation WNL. Infraspinatus strength improved to 4+/5, supraspinatus 4/5. Patient has been compliant with HEP. We did rotator cuff strengthening with yellow theraband, scapular stabilization exercises, and manual therapy to posterior capsule. Will continue current plan with progression to moderate resistance next session.",
  
  back_discharge: "Final session for low back pain. Patient reports pain has resolved, now 0/10 at rest and with activity. Can perform all ADLs without limitation. Forward flexion WNL, extension improved to WFL. Core strength improved to 5/5. Patient demonstrates proper body mechanics with lifting. Has been independent with HEP for 2 weeks. All goals met. Patient discharged with maintenance HEP and instructions to return PRN.",

  hip_evaluation: "New patient with left hip pain for past 3 months. Reports pain is worse with walking and sitting for long periods, rates pain as 5/10. AROM limited in hip flexion to 100 degrees, internal rotation 15 degrees with pain at end range. Strength testing reveals hip abductor weakness 3+/5, hip flexors 4/5. Positive FABER test on left, negative on right. Gait shows decreased weight bearing on left side with reduced stance time. Will focus on pain reduction, improving ROM and hip stabilizer strength. Plan for 2x weekly for 6 weeks.",

  neck_progress: "Third session for cervical strain. Patient reports 50% reduction in pain, now 3/10 with end-range movement. Headaches have decreased in frequency from daily to twice weekly. AROM improved in rotation bilaterally, now 65 degrees with minimal pain at end range. Upper trapezius tension reduced but still present. Performed manual therapy to cervical paraspinals and upper traps, followed by deep neck flexor training and postural exercises. Continued education on proper ergonomics at workstation. Will progress to self-management techniques next session.",

  daily_note: "This is session number 8 for this patient who is being treated for chronic low back pain. Patient reports that pain levels have improved since our last visit three days ago. Currently rates pain as 3/10 at rest and 5/10 with prolonged standing or walking, which is down from 5/10 and 7/10 respectively at our last session. Patient states that the home exercise program has been helpful, particularly the core stabilization exercises and the cat-cow stretches. Reports compliance with HEP about 5 days per week. Patient also mentions that they've been more mindful of their posture at work and have been taking regular breaks to stand and stretch every hour as we discussed. Some difficulty still noted with bending forward to tie shoes in the morning, but this has improved compared to two weeks ago. Patient denies any new injuries or changes in symptoms. Sleep has improved and is now able to sleep through the night without waking due to back pain. Patient's goal remains to return to recreational tennis which they have not played in 6 weeks.\n\nObjective findings today show continued improvement. Posture assessment reveals improved thoracic extension compared to last visit, though still demonstrates slight forward head posture. Lumbar range of motion measured at 75 degrees flexion with mild discomfort at end range, 20 degrees extension without pain, and side bending 25 degrees bilaterally. This represents improvement in flexion from 60 degrees at last visit. Palpation reveals decreased muscle guarding in the lumbar paraspinals, though some tenderness remains at L4-L5 level. Straight leg raise test negative bilaterally. Core strength testing shows improvement with plank hold now sustained for 45 seconds compared to 30 seconds last week. Hip flexor length has improved bilaterally with Thomas test showing only mild tightness on the right side. Gait pattern appears normalized with symmetric stride length and no antalgic positioning.\n\nPatient continues to make steady progress toward functional goals. Pain levels trending downward and functional mobility improving. Core strength and endurance showing measurable gains. Patient demonstrates good understanding of body mechanics and proper exercise technique. Short-term goals for next 2 weeks include reducing pain to 2/10 with activity and improving forward flexion to 85 degrees. Long-term goal remains return to tennis in 4-6 weeks with proper warm-up routine established.\n\nTreatment today included manual therapy techniques to lumbar spine including grade 3-4 joint mobilizations to L4-L5 segment, soft tissue mobilization to lumbar paraspinals and hip flexors. Performed therapeutic exercises including progression of core stabilization with dead bug exercise, bird dog with resistance band, and side plank with hip abduction. Added new exercise for hip flexor strengthening in standing. Reviewed and progressed home exercise program with emphasis on maintaining daily compliance. Educated patient on gradual return to tennis activities, recommending starting with gentle groundstrokes before progressing to serves and overhead shots. Patient tolerated treatment well with no adverse reactions. Plan to continue treatment 2 times per week for next 2 weeks, then reassess for potential decrease to 1 time per week. Patient verbalized understanding of treatment plan and HEP modifications.",

  discharge_note: "This is the final session for this patient who has been receiving physical therapy for right shoulder impingement syndrome. Patient was initially evaluated 8 weeks ago presenting with significant pain and functional limitations. At initial evaluation, patient reported pain level of 8/10 with overhead activities and 5/10 at rest, with severe difficulty performing work duties as a teacher requiring frequent overhead reaching for classroom materials. Patient also reported difficulty with self-care activities including washing hair, reaching into back seat of car, and putting on coat. Initial goals included reducing pain to 2/10 or less, achieving full pain-free range of motion, and returning to full work duties and recreational activities including swimming.\n\nAt discharge today, patient reports complete resolution of pain at rest, rating it 0/10, and only occasional mild discomfort of 1-2/10 with extreme overhead reaching after prolonged activity. Patient states they have been back to full work duties for the past 3 weeks without any limitations and have successfully returned to swimming 3 times per week. Patient expresses high satisfaction with treatment outcomes and feels confident in managing their condition independently. Reports excellent compliance with home exercise program throughout treatment and plans to continue maintenance exercises.\n\nObjective measurements at discharge demonstrate significant improvements from initial evaluation. Active range of motion of right shoulder shows full flexion to 175 degrees (initial: 140 degrees), abduction to 170 degrees (initial: 130 degrees), and external rotation to 85 degrees (initial: 60 degrees). All measurements are now within normal limits and pain-free. Internal rotation measured at T8 vertebral level, which is functional and symmetric to left side. Passive range of motion is full and pain-free in all planes. Strength testing reveals rotator cuff strength at 5/5 for all muscles including supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis, compared to initial measurements of 3+/5 to 4/5. Scapular stabilizer strength also improved to 5/5 for middle and lower trapezius and serratus anterior. Special tests including Neer's, Hawkins-Kennedy, and empty can test are all negative, compared to positive findings at initial evaluation. Posture assessment shows improved thoracic extension and scapular positioning. Patient demonstrates excellent body mechanics with overhead reaching and proper scapular control during functional movements.\n\nAll treatment goals have been successfully achieved. Patient has progressed from significant functional limitations and pain to full pain-free function with return to all desired activities. Patient demonstrates excellent understanding of condition, proper exercise technique, and strategies for injury prevention. Prognosis for long-term success is excellent given patient's high level of engagement and compliance throughout treatment.\n\nPatient is being discharged from physical therapy today with a comprehensive home exercise program for maintenance. Program includes rotator cuff strengthening exercises with resistance band (3 sets of 15 repetitions, 3-4 times per week), scapular stabilization exercises including prone Y-T-W exercises, and posterior capsule stretching. Patient has been educated on proper warm-up routine before swimming and overhead activities. Instructed to continue with current exercise program indefinitely for maintenance and injury prevention. Patient advised to gradually progress swimming intensity and duration as tolerated. Educated on warning signs that would warrant return to physical therapy including return of pain greater than 3/10 lasting more than 2-3 days, significant loss of range of motion, or inability to perform work or recreational activities. Patient encouraged to return to physical therapy if symptoms recur or for any future musculoskeletal concerns. Patient verbalized complete understanding of discharge instructions and maintenance program. Long-term prognosis is excellent with continued adherence to home program and activity modifications as needed.",

  acl_postsurgical: "This is the initial evaluation for a 24-year-old collegiate soccer player who underwent ACL reconstruction surgery 3 weeks ago. Patient reports the chief complaint as right knee pain and stiffness following the surgery. Surgery was performed on December 20th, 2024, using a hamstring autograft technique. The patient states that pain at rest is currently about 3 out of 10, but increases to 6 out of 10 with movement and therapy exercises. Pain with activity has been gradually improving over the past week. Patient reports taking ibuprofen 600mg three times daily as prescribed and occasionally uses prescribed pain medication at night if pain interferes with sleep. Sleep quality has improved over the past few days and patient is now able to sleep through most nights with only one waking due to discomfort. Patient expresses that their primary goal is to return to competitive soccer within 9 to 12 months and regain full strength and confidence in the knee.\n\nPatient reports that the injury occurred during a soccer match 4 months ago when planting and cutting to change direction. Felt and heard a pop, with immediate swelling and inability to continue playing. MRI confirmed complete ACL tear with no associated meniscal damage. Had been doing prehabilitation exercises for 6 weeks prior to surgery to optimize quadriceps strength and range of motion. Patient denies any previous injuries to this knee and reports left knee is completely asymptomatic. Currently taking ibuprofen and occasional oxycodone as mentioned. No known drug allergies. Patient is otherwise healthy and active.\n\nObjective examination reveals patient ambulating with bilateral axillary crutches demonstrating weight-bearing as tolerated gait pattern per physician protocol. Observes moderate antalgic gait with decreased stance time on right lower extremity and reduced knee flexion during swing phase. Incision sites appear well-healed with no signs of infection, minimal scar tissue formation noted. Surgical portals are clean and dry. Joint effusion is moderate, measuring 2cm larger in circumference compared to left knee at mid-patella. No ecchymosis present at this time.\n\nActive range of motion of right knee measured at 0 to 95 degrees of flexion with pain reported at 4/10 at end range and muscle guarding noted. Extension measured at minus 5 degrees, lacking full extension compared to left knee which demonstrates full extension of 0 degrees and hyperextension to 5 degrees. Passive range of motion reveals right knee flexion to 105 degrees with firm end feel and pain at 5/10. Extension passively achieves minus 3 degrees. Left knee range of motion is full and pain-free at 0 to 140 degrees flexion.\n\nStrength testing demonstrates significant quadriceps inhibition on the right with difficulty achieving active quadriceps contraction. Able to perform quad sets with visual and tactile cueing but unable to achieve superior patellar glide. Strength graded at 2/5. Hamstring strength on right measured at 3/5 due to surgical site and harvest site tenderness. Left lower extremity strength is 5/5 throughout. Hip strength appears maintained bilaterally at 5/5 for flexion, extension, abduction and adduction. Patellar mobility is moderately restricted in all directions on the right compared to left, likely due to effusion and guarding.\n\nSpecial tests were deferred at this stage given recent surgical status. Girth measurements taken at mid-patella show 2cm difference, with right measuring 40cm and left 38cm, confirming moderate effusion. Thigh girth at 10cm proximal to superior pole of patella shows right measuring 45cm and left 48cm, indicating early quadriceps atrophy of 3cm on the surgical side.\n\nAssessment indicates patient is progressing appropriately for 3 weeks post-ACL reconstruction status post hamstring autograft. Current impairments include moderate joint effusion, limited range of motion in both flexion and particularly extension, significant quadriceps inhibition and weakness, mild hamstring weakness related to graft harvest site, antalgic gait pattern, and early signs of quadriceps atrophy. Patient demonstrates good understanding of surgical precautions and importance of early rehabilitation. Prognosis for return to sport is good given patient's age, motivation level, and lack of associated injuries.\n\nTreatment plan will focus on immediate goals of reducing effusion and pain, achieving full extension equal to contralateral side within 2 weeks, improving flexion to 110 degrees within 2 weeks, and improving quadriceps activation and strength. Long-term goals include achieving full pain-free range of motion equal to left knee within 6 weeks, normalizing gait pattern within 6 weeks, and progressive strengthening to achieve 85% strength compared to uninvolved side by 4 months post-op as required for running progression.\n\nPlan includes physical therapy 3 times per week initially, decreasing frequency as patient progresses. Today's treatment included cryotherapy to right knee using ice pack for 20 minutes to address effusion and pain. Performed gentle soft tissue mobilization to quadriceps to decrease muscle guarding and improve muscle activation. Instructed patient in proper quad setting technique with emphasis on superior patellar glide and hold for 5 seconds, to be performed 3 sets of 20 repetitions every 2 hours while awake. Straight leg raises were initiated in all 4 planes with instructions for 2 sets of 15 repetitions, 3 times daily. Ankle pumps prescribed to prevent DVT and maintain lower leg circulation, to be performed frequently throughout the day. Heel slides for range of motion performed within pain-free range, 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times daily. Prone hangs prescribed for extension using towel roll under ankle, gravity-assisted, for 10 minutes 3 times daily. Patellar mobilizations taught for home program in all four directions, 2 sets of 15 repetitions, twice daily. Gait training performed with emphasis on normalizing gait mechanics while maintaining weight-bearing restrictions per protocol. Instructed to continue use of crutches until gait is normalized and physician clearance is obtained.\n\nHome exercise program reviewed with patient, who demonstrated good understanding and proper technique. Written instructions provided. Patient educated on importance of icing 4-5 times per day for 20 minutes to control inflammation and effusion. Compression wrap should be worn during day, removed at night. Leg elevation above heart level recommended as much as possible. Patient instructed to monitor for signs of infection, DVT, or other complications and report immediately. Follow-up appointment scheduled in 3 days to monitor progress and advance exercises as appropriate. Patient verbalized understanding of all instructions and expressed readiness to begin rehabilitation program. Physician follow-up appointment confirmed for next week."
