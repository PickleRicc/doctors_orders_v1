  knee_evaluation: "This is a comprehensive evaluation for a 45-year-old male software engineer presenting with right knee pain. The patient reports that the pain began approximately 2 weeks ago after increasing his running mileage from 3 miles to 5 miles three times per week. He describes the pain as sharp and intermittent, located primarily on the medial aspect of the right knee, and rates it as a 6/10 during activity and 3/10 at rest. Pain is significantly worse when ascending and descending stairs and after sitting for prolonged periods. Patient also reports occasional clicking, popping sensations, and morning stiffness that lasts about 20-30 minutes after waking. The patient denies any specific injury event but mentions that he recently changed his running shoes. No previous injuries to this knee, though he did have a mild left ankle sprain about 2 years ago that resolved with PT. Patient is otherwise healthy, takes no medications regularly, and has been running consistently for fitness for the past 5 years. He reports his goals are to return to pain-free running and be able to participate in a 10K race scheduled in 3 months.\n\nUpon objective examination, the patient presents with an antalgic gait pattern, demonstrating decreased stance time on the right lower extremity and reduced knee flexion during swing phase. Observation reveals mild joint effusion of the right knee with no visible bruising or deformity. Active range of motion measurements show right knee flexion limited to 0-110 degrees with pain reported at end range, compared to 0-135 degrees on the left. Extension is full bilaterally. Passive ROM of the right knee produces pain at end-range flexion and reveals increased pain with medial joint line palpation. Strength testing demonstrates quadriceps weakness at 4-/5 on the right compared to 5/5 on the left, and hamstrings at 4/5 on the right compared to 5/5 on the left. Special tests are positive for McMurray's with pain and clicking on the medial side, negative Lachman's test, negative anterior and posterior drawer tests, and negative valgus and varus stress tests. Patellar tracking appears slightly lateral with a positive Clarke's test. Palpation reveals tenderness along the medial joint line and mild tenderness of the pes anserine bursa. No significant tenderness along the lateral joint line, patellar tendon, or IT band.\n\nAssessment: Patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with a medial meniscus irritation/tear and early patellofemoral pain syndrome. Contributing factors include possible training errors with sudden increase in running volume, potential biomechanical factors including mild pronation observed during stance phase, and quadriceps weakness. Functional limitations include inability to run, difficulty with stairs, and pain with prolonged sitting.\n\nFor our treatment plan, we will start with a focus on pain management using ice application 15-20 minutes 3x/day, gentle ROM exercises, and activity modification including temporary cessation of running with substitution of low-impact cardiovascular activities like swimming or cycling. I'm recommending PT 2 times per week for 4-6 weeks. Initial interventions will include gentle joint mobilizations, soft tissue mobilization to the medial structures of the knee, quadriceps and hamstring strengthening with emphasis on VMO activation, and progressive weight-bearing exercises as tolerated. The home exercise program will include quad sets, straight leg raises, heel slides, and hamstring stretches to be performed 2x/day. Short-term goals include reducing pain to 2/10 or less during daily activities within 2 weeks and increasing knee flexion to 125 degrees. Long-term goals include returning to a normal gait pattern within 3 weeks, achieving full, pain-free ROM within 4 weeks, 5/5 strength in all knee musculature within 6 weeks, and gradual return to running with a proper training progression plan starting at week 6-8 depending on progress.",
  
  shoulder_progress: "Today is our 5th session for right shoulder impingement. Patient reports pain has decreased from 7/10 to 4/10. Can now reach overhead without significant pain. AROM improved to 160 degrees flexion, 150 degrees abduction. External rotation WNL. Infraspinatus strength improved to 4+/5, supraspinatus 4/5. Patient has been compliant with HEP. We did rotator cuff strengthening with yellow theraband, scapular stabilization exercises, and manual therapy to posterior capsule. Will continue current plan with progression to moderate resistance next session.",
  
  back_discharge: "Final session for low back pain. Patient reports pain has resolved, now 0/10 at rest and with activity. Can perform all ADLs without limitation. Forward flexion WNL, extension improved to WFL. Core strength improved to 5/5. Patient demonstrates proper body mechanics with lifting. Has been independent with HEP for 2 weeks. All goals met. Patient discharged with maintenance HEP and instructions to return PRN.",

  hip_evaluation: "New patient with left hip pain for past 3 months. Reports pain is worse with walking and sitting for long periods, rates pain as 5/10. AROM limited in hip flexion to 100 degrees, internal rotation 15 degrees with pain at end range. Strength testing reveals hip abductor weakness 3+/5, hip flexors 4/5. Positive FABER test on left, negative on right. Gait shows decreased weight bearing on left side with reduced stance time. Will focus on pain reduction, improving ROM and hip stabilizer strength. Plan for 2x weekly for 6 weeks.",

  neck_progress: "Third session for cervical strain. Patient reports 50% reduction in pain, now 3/10 with end-range movement. Headaches have decreased in frequency from daily to twice weekly. AROM improved in rotation bilaterally, now 65 degrees with minimal pain at end range. Upper trapezius tension reduced but still present. Performed manual therapy to cervical paraspinals and upper traps, followed by deep neck flexor training and postural exercises. Continued education on proper ergonomics at workstation. Will progress to self-management techniques next session."
