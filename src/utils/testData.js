  knee_evaluation: "This is a comprehensive evaluation for a 45-year-old male software engineer presenting with right knee pain. The patient reports that the pain began approximately 2 weeks ago after increasing his running mileage from 3 miles to 5 miles three times per week. He describes the pain as sharp and intermittent, located primarily on the medial aspect of the right knee, and rates it as a 6/10 during activity and 3/10 at rest. Pain is significantly worse when ascending and descending stairs and after sitting for prolonged periods. Patient also reports occasional clicking, popping sensations, and morning stiffness that lasts about 20-30 minutes after waking. The patient denies any specific injury event but mentions that he recently changed his running shoes. No previous injuries to this knee, though he did have a mild left ankle sprain about 2 years ago that resolved with PT. Patient is otherwise healthy, takes no medications regularly, and has been running consistently for fitness for the past 5 years. He reports his goals are to return to pain-free running and be able to participate in a 10K race scheduled in 3 months.\n\nUpon objective examination, the patient presents with an antalgic gait pattern, demonstrating decreased stance time on the right lower extremity and reduced knee flexion during swing phase. Observation reveals mild joint effusion of the right knee with no visible bruising or deformity. Active range of motion measurements show right knee flexion limited to 0-110 degrees with pain reported at end range, compared to 0-135 degrees on the left. Extension is full bilaterally. Passive ROM of the right knee produces pain at end-range flexion and reveals increased pain with medial joint line palpation. Strength testing demonstrates quadriceps weakness at 4-/5 on the right compared to 5/5 on the left, and hamstrings at 4/5 on the right compared to 5/5 on the left. Special tests are positive for McMurray's with pain and clicking on the medial side, negative Lachman's test, negative anterior and posterior drawer tests, and negative valgus and varus stress tests. Patellar tracking appears slightly lateral with a positive Clarke's test. Palpation reveals tenderness along the medial joint line and mild tenderness of the pes anserine bursa. No significant tenderness along the lateral joint line, patellar tendon, or IT band.\n\nAssessment: Patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with a medial meniscus irritation/tear and early patellofemoral pain syndrome. Contributing factors include possible training errors with sudden increase in running volume, potential biomechanical factors including mild pronation observed during stance phase, and quadriceps weakness. Functional limitations include inability to run, difficulty with stairs, and pain with prolonged sitting.\n\nFor our treatment plan, we will start with a focus on pain management using ice application 15-20 minutes 3x/day, gentle ROM exercises, and activity modification including temporary cessation of running with substitution of low-impact cardiovascular activities like swimming or cycling. I'm recommending PT 2 times per week for 4-6 weeks. Initial interventions will include gentle joint mobilizations, soft tissue mobilization to the medial structures of the knee, quadriceps and hamstring strengthening with emphasis on VMO activation, and progressive weight-bearing exercises as tolerated. The home exercise program will include quad sets, straight leg raises, heel slides, and hamstring stretches to be performed 2x/day. Short-term goals include reducing pain to 2/10 or less during daily activities within 2 weeks and increasing knee flexion to 125 degrees. Long-term goals include returning to a normal gait pattern within 3 weeks, achieving full, pain-free ROM within 4 weeks, 5/5 strength in all knee musculature within 6 weeks, and gradual return to running with a proper training progression plan starting at week 6-8 depending on progress.",
  
  shoulder_progress: "Today is our 5th session for right shoulder impingement. Patient reports pain has decreased from 7/10 to 4/10. Can now reach overhead without significant pain. AROM improved to 160 degrees flexion, 150 degrees abduction. External rotation WNL. Infraspinatus strength improved to 4+/5, supraspinatus 4/5. Patient has been compliant with HEP. We did rotator cuff strengthening with yellow theraband, scapular stabilization exercises, and manual therapy to posterior capsule. Will continue current plan with progression to moderate resistance next session.",
  
  back_discharge: "Final session for low back pain. Patient reports pain has resolved, now 0/10 at rest and with activity. Can perform all ADLs without limitation. Forward flexion WNL, extension improved to WFL. Core strength improved to 5/5. Patient demonstrates proper body mechanics with lifting. Has been independent with HEP for 2 weeks. All goals met. Patient discharged with maintenance HEP and instructions to return PRN.",

  hip_evaluation: "New patient with left hip pain for past 3 months. Reports pain is worse with walking and sitting for long periods, rates pain as 5/10. AROM limited in hip flexion to 100 degrees, internal rotation 15 degrees with pain at end range. Strength testing reveals hip abductor weakness 3+/5, hip flexors 4/5. Positive FABER test on left, negative on right. Gait shows decreased weight bearing on left side with reduced stance time. Will focus on pain reduction, improving ROM and hip stabilizer strength. Plan for 2x weekly for 6 weeks.",

  neck_progress: "Third session for cervical strain. Patient reports 50% reduction in pain, now 3/10 with end-range movement. Headaches have decreased in frequency from daily to twice weekly. AROM improved in rotation bilaterally, now 65 degrees with minimal pain at end range. Upper trapezius tension reduced but still present. Performed manual therapy to cervical paraspinals and upper traps, followed by deep neck flexor training and postural exercises. Continued education on proper ergonomics at workstation. Will progress to self-management techniques next session.",

  daily_note: "This is session number 8 for this patient who is being treated for chronic low back pain. Patient reports that pain levels have improved since our last visit three days ago. Currently rates pain as 3/10 at rest and 5/10 with prolonged standing or walking, which is down from 5/10 and 7/10 respectively at our last session. Patient states that the home exercise program has been helpful, particularly the core stabilization exercises and the cat-cow stretches. Reports compliance with HEP about 5 days per week. Patient also mentions that they've been more mindful of their posture at work and have been taking regular breaks to stand and stretch every hour as we discussed. Some difficulty still noted with bending forward to tie shoes in the morning, but this has improved compared to two weeks ago. Patient denies any new injuries or changes in symptoms. Sleep has improved and is now able to sleep through the night without waking due to back pain. Patient's goal remains to return to recreational tennis which they have not played in 6 weeks.\n\nObjective findings today show continued improvement. Posture assessment reveals improved thoracic extension compared to last visit, though still demonstrates slight forward head posture. Lumbar range of motion measured at 75 degrees flexion with mild discomfort at end range, 20 degrees extension without pain, and side bending 25 degrees bilaterally. This represents improvement in flexion from 60 degrees at last visit. Palpation reveals decreased muscle guarding in the lumbar paraspinals, though some tenderness remains at L4-L5 level. Straight leg raise test negative bilaterally. Core strength testing shows improvement with plank hold now sustained for 45 seconds compared to 30 seconds last week. Hip flexor length has improved bilaterally with Thomas test showing only mild tightness on the right side. Gait pattern appears normalized with symmetric stride length and no antalgic positioning.\n\nPatient continues to make steady progress toward functional goals. Pain levels trending downward and functional mobility improving. Core strength and endurance showing measurable gains. Patient demonstrates good understanding of body mechanics and proper exercise technique. Short-term goals for next 2 weeks include reducing pain to 2/10 with activity and improving forward flexion to 85 degrees. Long-term goal remains return to tennis in 4-6 weeks with proper warm-up routine established.\n\nTreatment today included manual therapy techniques to lumbar spine including grade 3-4 joint mobilizations to L4-L5 segment, soft tissue mobilization to lumbar paraspinals and hip flexors. Performed therapeutic exercises including progression of core stabilization with dead bug exercise, bird dog with resistance band, and side plank with hip abduction. Added new exercise for hip flexor strengthening in standing. Reviewed and progressed home exercise program with emphasis on maintaining daily compliance. Educated patient on gradual return to tennis activities, recommending starting with gentle groundstrokes before progressing to serves and overhead shots. Patient tolerated treatment well with no adverse reactions. Plan to continue treatment 2 times per week for next 2 weeks, then reassess for potential decrease to 1 time per week. Patient verbalized understanding of treatment plan and HEP modifications.",

  discharge_note: "This is the final session for this patient who has been receiving physical therapy for right shoulder impingement syndrome. Patient was initially evaluated 8 weeks ago presenting with significant pain and functional limitations. At initial evaluation, patient reported pain level of 8/10 with overhead activities and 5/10 at rest, with severe difficulty performing work duties as a teacher requiring frequent overhead reaching for classroom materials. Patient also reported difficulty with self-care activities including washing hair, reaching into back seat of car, and putting on coat. Initial goals included reducing pain to 2/10 or less, achieving full pain-free range of motion, and returning to full work duties and recreational activities including swimming.\n\nAt discharge today, patient reports complete resolution of pain at rest, rating it 0/10, and only occasional mild discomfort of 1-2/10 with extreme overhead reaching after prolonged activity. Patient states they have been back to full work duties for the past 3 weeks without any limitations and have successfully returned to swimming 3 times per week. Patient expresses high satisfaction with treatment outcomes and feels confident in managing their condition independently. Reports excellent compliance with home exercise program throughout treatment and plans to continue maintenance exercises.\n\nObjective measurements at discharge demonstrate significant improvements from initial evaluation. Active range of motion of right shoulder shows full flexion to 175 degrees (initial: 140 degrees), abduction to 170 degrees (initial: 130 degrees), and external rotation to 85 degrees (initial: 60 degrees). All measurements are now within normal limits and pain-free. Internal rotation measured at T8 vertebral level, which is functional and symmetric to left side. Passive range of motion is full and pain-free in all planes. Strength testing reveals rotator cuff strength at 5/5 for all muscles including supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis, compared to initial measurements of 3+/5 to 4/5. Scapular stabilizer strength also improved to 5/5 for middle and lower trapezius and serratus anterior. Special tests including Neer's, Hawkins-Kennedy, and empty can test are all negative, compared to positive findings at initial evaluation. Posture assessment shows improved thoracic extension and scapular positioning. Patient demonstrates excellent body mechanics with overhead reaching and proper scapular control during functional movements.\n\nAll treatment goals have been successfully achieved. Patient has progressed from significant functional limitations and pain to full pain-free function with return to all desired activities. Patient demonstrates excellent understanding of condition, proper exercise technique, and strategies for injury prevention. Prognosis for long-term success is excellent given patient's high level of engagement and compliance throughout treatment.\n\nPatient is being discharged from physical therapy today with a comprehensive home exercise program for maintenance. Program includes rotator cuff strengthening exercises with resistance band (3 sets of 15 repetitions, 3-4 times per week), scapular stabilization exercises including prone Y-T-W exercises, and posterior capsule stretching. Patient has been educated on proper warm-up routine before swimming and overhead activities. Instructed to continue with current exercise program indefinitely for maintenance and injury prevention. Patient advised to gradually progress swimming intensity and duration as tolerated. Educated on warning signs that would warrant return to physical therapy including return of pain greater than 3/10 lasting more than 2-3 days, significant loss of range of motion, or inability to perform work or recreational activities. Patient encouraged to return to physical therapy if symptoms recur or for any future musculoskeletal concerns. Patient verbalized complete understanding of discharge instructions and maintenance program. Long-term prognosis is excellent with continued adherence to home program and activity modifications as needed."
